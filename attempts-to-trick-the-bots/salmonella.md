# Salmonella

Salmonella intentionally exploits the generalized nature of front-running setups. The goal of sandwich trading is to exploit the slippage of unintended victims, so this strategy turns the tables on the exploiters. Itâ€™s a regular ERC20 token, which behaves exactly like any other ERC20 token in usual use cases. However, it has some unique logic to detect when anyone other than the specified owner is transacting it, and in these situations, it only returns 10% of the specified amount - despite emitting event logs which match a trade, showing the entire amount.
