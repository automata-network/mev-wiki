## Different approaches to tackling the MEV problem <a id="different-approaches-to-tackling-the-mev-problem"></a>

There are largely 2 schools of thought when it comes to approaching the MEV problem

1. ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%288%29.png)Offense - MEV is here to stay so let's find a way to extract and democratize it.
2. ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)Defense - MEV is bad so let's try to prevent it.

Projects like Automata Network are in the Defense camp where the solution [Conveyor](https://docs.ata.network/mev/solutions/mev-minimization-prevention/#conveyor-the-automata-network-approach-to-tackling-mev) ingests transactions and outputs transactions in a determined order. This creates a front-running-free zone that removes the chaos of transaction reordering.

To further explain, we have put different approaches into 3 categories:
