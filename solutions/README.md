## Different approaches to tackling the MEV problem <a id="different-approaches-to-tackling-the-mev-problem"></a>

There are largely two schools of thought when it comes to approaching the MEV problem:

1. ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2810%29.png)**Offense** - MEV is here to stay so let's find a way to extract and democratize it.
2. ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)**Defense** - MEV is bad so let's try to prevent it.

Projects like Automata Network are in the Defense camp where the solution [Conveyor](https://docs.ata.network/mev/solutions/mev-minimization-prevention/#conveyor-the-automata-network-approach-to-tackling-mev) ingests and outputs transactions in a determined order. This creates a front-running-free zone that removes the chaos of transaction reordering.

To further explain, we have put different approaches into three categories:
