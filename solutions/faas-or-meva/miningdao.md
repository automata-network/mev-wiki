# MiningDAO

### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2810%29.png)MiningDAO

MiningDAO is building a decentralized and transparent protocol for block formation that aims to pass 100% of MEV to miners. Anyone with an Ethereum address can propose the next block to be mined \(via a block seal hash\), and attach a bounty for successfully mining it. The mining pools would then mine on the highest-bounty proposal.

One is for searchers to submit Flashbots-compatible bundles. The other is the Archer Relay Network \(powers Archerswap\) where users can submit private transactions and be protected from malicious MEV.
