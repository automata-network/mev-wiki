# SecretSwap \(Secret Network\)

## ![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)Secret Swap

Secret Swap is an automated market maker \(AMM\) liquidity protocol. There is no orderbook, no centralized party, and no central facilitator of trade. Using Secret Contracts, the mempool of potential Secret Swap transactions are kept entirely encrypted - protecting users from MEV, front-running attacks and providing an increased level of privacy compared to traditional AMMs.

The protocol uses swap secret contract based tokens \(SNIP-20s\) on Secret Network. Given the encrypted nature of SNIP-20s secret contracts, inputs to a transaction/contract are encrypted while they are on the mempool and cannot be front-run by any adversary. Users will have to pay for gas and 0.3% swap fees with the $SCRT token to use Secret Swap.
