# Vega protocol

Traditionally, fairness in a blockchain has been defined in absolute terms, i.e. once a transaction is seen by a sufficient number of validators, it will be executed in some block, soon. Vega's proposal is to add a module to blockchains that supports the concept of relative fairness so that competing transactions may be sequenced under a known and understood protocol, and not subject to a validator’s discretion.

"_If there is a time t such that all honest validators saw a before t and b after t, then a must be scheduled before b”._ This is a property that can be assured of at any time with a minimal impact on performance.

To get the best combination, their current approach is a hybrid of the two. In normal operation, the protocol will assure block fairness. If the network detects that this causes a bottleneck, it temporarily switches to the timed approach \(thus sacrificing a little fairness for performance\), before switching back once the bottleneck is resolved. However, Vega will ultimately make the level of fairness customisable by market.
